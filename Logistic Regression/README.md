# Assignment 2 - Logistic Regression

Given the movie reviews from IMDb, build a binary text classifier to classify them into a '0' (Negative) and '1' (Positive) review. We use a pre-defined bag of words.

The dataset comes from 'Large Movie Review Dataset' by Andrew Lee Maas from Stanford. More about the dataset can be found here at http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ 

The dataset on which experiments were done, can be found at http://tiny.cc/xwqqyy
