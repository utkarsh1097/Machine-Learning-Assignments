# Assignment 2(a) - Neural Networks

We will build a neural network from scratch and train it to classify Devanagari Handwritten Characters. The dataset consists of grayscale images of size 32x32. Each image can be classified into 46 different classes - 36 Devanagari characters and 10 Devanagari numerals. The training set consists of 78200 training examples.

The dataset was created by Shailesh Acharya and Prashnna Kumar Gyawali using extraction and manual annotation of thousands of characters from handwritten documents. More information can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Devanagari+Handwritten+Character+Dataset 

TODO: 
	- 1. Add instructions on how to execute
	- 2. Add dataset on which experiments were done
